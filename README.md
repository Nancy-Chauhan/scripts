### scripts

Hola! ðŸ‘‹

#### github_graphql_api.py
GraphQL is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data.

You can quickly play around `GitHub's GraphQL Explorer` to find things related to GitHub API or simply use my script ðŸ˜‰
